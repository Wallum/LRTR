	description = The Atmospheric Analysis Satellite that we launched was a good first step to understanding how the upper atmosphere affects the weather. However, our meteorologists want to see images of the clouds to better assess the situtation.&br;&br;Launch our first official weather satellite into orbit.

	synopsis = Launch the first weather satellite

	completedMessage = Success! The images provided from this satellite have proven that weather satellites can be extremely effective in helping meteorologists predict the weather.
