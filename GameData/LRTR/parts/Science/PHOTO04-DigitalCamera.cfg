	description = The Ultra Resolution Digital Imaging Camera is used to take planetary photographs from space. This camera stores all of the imaging data digitally and these images can be transmitted fully back to Earth. Historically, these were flown as Spy Satellites under the KH-11 Kennen name, and also used in a similar fashion by the Hubble Space Telescope. \n\nLevel 4 Planetary Photography Experiment. Can gather 100% of Photography Science and transmit for full recovery.
