	description = The High Resolution Imaging Device is used to take images in the visible wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This imager takes very high resolution images and can show details previously undiscovered on other planetary bodies. Historically, this type of camera was flown on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\n\nThe images can be transmitted for full science value. Level 5 Visible Imaging Experiment can gather 100% of Visible Imaging Science.
